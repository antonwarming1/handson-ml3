    "# Real-World SVM Exercise: Predicting Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is when customers stop doing business with a company. Being able to predict churn is critical for many businesses, as it's usually more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Telco Customer Churn dataset. This dataset contains information about a telecom company's customers, including various attributes and whether they churned (left the company) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess the data\n",
    "2. Split the data into training and testing sets\n",
    "3. Train an SVM model with a linear kernel\n",
    "4. Train an SVM model with an RBF kernel\n",
    "5. Evaluate and compare both models\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"
