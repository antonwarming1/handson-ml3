    "# DBSCAN Clustering Exercise: Mall Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify customer segments based on their shopping behavior. This analysis will help understand different customer groups and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "The Mall Customer Segmentation dataset contains information about customers including:\n",
    "- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer\n",
    "- Gender: Customer's gender\n",
    "- Age: Customer's age\n",
    "- Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars\n",
    "- Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why DBSCAN?\n",
    "DBSCAN is particularly useful for this dataset because:\n",
    "1. It can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes\n",
    "2. It can detect outliers (unusual customer behavior)\n",
    "3. It doesn't assume clusters are spherical\n",
    "4. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "1. Load and explore the dataset\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Implement DBSCAN clustering\n",
    "4. Evaluate the clustering results\n",
    "5. Visualize the customer segments\n",
    "6. Analyze segment characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below and fill in the code where indicated."
